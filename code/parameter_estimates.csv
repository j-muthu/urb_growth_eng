gamma,Elasticity of commuting cost w.r.t. distance,0.03,0.05,0.08,unitless,"UK adaptation of DP (2023) Table I p.2238; lower UK values reflect shorter commuting distances (DfT NTS)"
theta,Population elasticity of congestion (travel speed),0.05,0.06,0.07,unitless,"UK adapted from DP (2023) Table I p.2238 cols 4-5; higher UK values reflect denser road networks"
